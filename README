Lift, Wicket, Ruby on Rails, ... are great web frameworks. But all of them have their controllers on the server side, making them essential server side frameworks (even though they all have ajax support).

I want to make a client side framework. This is an experimental repository for now. The code is written in scala + javascript and the database is mongodb.I borrow some stuff from the Lift Web Framework (since this is written in scala). 

Finished:
- extremely easy way to make ajax calls, including client side proxy.
- prove of concept implementation of mongodb serialization.

Still todo:
- maven archetypes
- code cleanup/ separation library code and project code.
- improve error handling of ajax call.
- handle default url /
- generic db code?
- views

 
Future goals:
- something for i18n, and for view based on user-agent ( to change views depending on user-agent settings).
- something for nice urls.
- that's about it.... this is not a big framework. Just a minimal one to get a nice ajax app up and running and do some really really rapid development.
