This is my gazzilionth attempt at a web framework that is reusable after one app is being built with it. The reason why I am not very happy with existing frameworks, is that they start from the server side.
I, as a javascript junkie, wants to start client side.

However, I need a serious language on the server too. I don't like javascript on the server, need to have much libraries. Since I am very familiar with the java platform, but don't like the java language too much, I have picked Scala.

I borrow some stuff from the Lift Web Framework (since this is written in scala). But I don't want to learn Lift, looks to big and complicated for my needs.


So here is the plan:
- all views are just plain html using jquery and javascript as helpers. Maybe some templates to wrap html fragments into page templates, like in Lift.
- all communication happens by ajax to one servlet.
- the servlet dispatches the calls to scala classes. they accessses the mongodb database. 
 

Future goals:
- something for i18n, and for view based on user-agent ( to change views depending on user-agent settings).
- something for nice urls.
- that's about it.... this is not being a big framework, need should be inside. 

Okay, lets get started!
